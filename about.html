<h4>Why ride 1300km?</h4>

<p>Each group members have had some sort of close encounter with cancers, breast, testicular or other types as well. And while this illness can often seem implacable to the patients and their family, their are simple and practical actions one can take to increase the chances of early diagnosis. Thereby massively increasing survival rate.</p>

<p>Bikeforballs aims to bring simple actions to the wider number by using our common platform: cycling. Breakthrough the stigma around cancers affecting the epitome of woman and manhood by creating the space for discussion all the while having fun. And finally raise funds to help fight the illness and those fighting it in their own body or as part of the medical corps.</p>

<h4>When did we start?</h4>

<p>Bike For Balls started in 2018 with a 520km ride from Amsterdam to Paris. It continued in 2019 with a 1000km ride from Amsterdam to Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Respectively, these rides raised 3500&euro; &amp; 6800&euro; for Cancer research.</p>

<p>More importantly, people were checking themselves for the first time and telling their stories of how cancer has impacted the lives of their loved ones.</p>

<p>Bike For Balls even made it to the top 3% of all private fund raising campaigns in the UK.</p>

<h4>Why should I check myself?</h4>

<p>Testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer for 18 - 38 year old men. Some 72.000&nbsp;cases are diagnosed each year worldwide. The good news is that 99.9% of men who are diagnosed within stage 1 (early) survive. If you fail to diagnose early, the chances of survival can drop by over 20%.</p>

<p>Yann was lucky enough to self diagnose by checking himself. Two days later he went through surgery, one week later could&#39;ve been fatal. Checking yourself on a regular basis can make a vital difference.</p>

<p>Below you can find Yann&#39;s personal favorite videos on how to navigate yourself around your testicles. Some say that Yann is an expert in this field, but please note he is not medically licensed to check you, whatever he says.</p>
