# CYBWY
Check Yourself before Wreck Yourself

CYBWY is a 2D game promoting cancer prevention with 2 tutorials (breasts & testicular) showing simple gestures to self-diagnose.

Elia, Maya and I made this 2D Canvas game as part of a IronHack project, it also uses JavaScripts (ES6), HTML & CSS.

The aim of the game is for a pair of hand (main character) to gather as many pairs of boobs & boobs ONLY in private places. 

If you end up touching either an observer or a pair of boobs/balls in public you have lost the game and can either read up on self-diagnosis gestures or play again!

Enjoy the game and the touching!

Maya, Elia & Yann.
